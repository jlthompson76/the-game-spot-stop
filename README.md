### The Game Spot Stop

The Game Spot Stop is seeking customer feedback.

- Ask user the title and their score of the 2 most recent games they played

- Display the game name and scores

- If the score is 4/5 or 5/5 then the game gets a green label, otherwise it gets a red label.

- At the end: draw out DOM tree structure of your page

More Detail: 

- Page setup: start from scratch! `<!DOCTYPE html>`

- Create a button that fires prompt() to ask for user input. You can use an array to store the data, but you don't have to.

- Display the game name and scores: use two <p>s, an id or class

- Use querySelector() or querySelectorAll()

- If the score is 4/5 or 5/5 then change the text to green, otherwise make it red.

- When drawing the DOM tree structure, start at the root element
